First, we downloaded the dataset and then extracted it. We then figured out how to manage the 105gb dataset.

Then we applied preprocessing. This involved removing redundant columns from the dataset.

Then we created the producer and 3 consumers subscribed to the producer’s data stream.

Then we applied A-Priori, PYC, and Bloom’s algorithms on the consumers respectively. To access the data, we used the Sliding Window approach.
Finally, we lined out consumers to a MongoDB database to store the results.

As a bonus we also added a bash script to make it easier to run our assignment.
